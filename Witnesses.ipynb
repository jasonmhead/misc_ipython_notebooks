 no, actually saw the whenever i exited was after he was dead,   mm hmm. well, and  as i?m seeing </li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> and um, dar..darren wilson had a physical interaction or something like that. i was tellin' him i did not see that. only saw while he was next to the car.  i understand that you wouldn?t have se</li><li>w michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was as you were exiting on to the balcony. um, and uh, that was the first time that you him. you did not see him until you were exiting the door onto the balcony. um, and-and that obviously in t</li><li>t not mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> at that point. and then you went into the monte carlo with the things you talked about today. that dorian was there at the monte carlo, your attention was drawn to that. ok, so i just wanted to </li><li>heard it, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot while he was trying to pull away from the guy. um, that was on page 17 ofthe-of the interview. so,  that indicated was that someone may have said that to   uh huh.  you had already indi</li><li>heard it, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot while tryin? to pull the guy.? and then, at the point is when the detective actually stopped you and said \"now just want firsthand? and you said \"ok, you got firsthand.? and-and you exp</li><li>heard it, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot while tryin? to pull the guy.? and then you trailed off because the detective cut you off and said \"no ijust want firsthand information.? 0k?  0k.  and then you said um, you know that u</li><li>t uh, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was unarmed and had his hands up. and i mean that sounds like someone was telling you that. and obviously you?ve already talked about you wouldn?t know whether he was armed or not.  right.  ok. </li><li>idn't see <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> at that time until you were going out on your-  63  atty  au sa  atty  au sa  witness  sa:    ausa  sa:  au sa  witness  ausa  witness  au sa  witness  ausa  witness  on your balcony. um, and so</li><li> was mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, until after i had known that his body was dead on the ground.  ausa sure.  witness because i could not see face, i could only see hat.  ausa yeah, and we should clarify that. at-at the time tha</li><li> was mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> that was out there in the street.  exactly.  is that right?

(ui)  he-he actually said it had been a couple times that i?ve seen him, and not known who it was. so at least like one or twice.  do you re</li><li>o michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>. ah, it?s ah, my understanding, ah that you um, you have a pretty high opinion of the st. louis county medical examiner?s office just from what i?ve seen and statements you?ve given, etc. do you</li><li>f um, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> that was kept there and ah, um, um so that was largely at the clothing and the um the photographs. this-this is with the is what i was looking at just before you came. ah, they had taken photogr</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>'s body. um, ah, we?ve reviewed the ah, news conference ah, that you had on august 18 of 2014.  that was on ah, day one after i had looked at the autopsy.  alright. and who the autopsy was that o</li><li>f michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>? do you recall?  (ui)  this-this might help you out too. i've got ah, i this look like the diagram that you and ah mr. (ph) produced from the autopsy? if you want to take a look at that, and tha</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s family?  ah, to the lawyers for them, mr. and all the family.  okay.  and they decided that they had some relationship with the times in there but, and ah, let me see, sorry. idon?t have the e</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot from behind?  think it?s good evidence for that um, it would occur if-if ah, his hands were in the air say and-and-and shot from behack, a behind. it could also be that if it were a-acr</li><li>d michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> at the time of the shooting. is that fair? lt-it was behind the-the forearm at the time of the shooting but the forearm could take different positions like the back can't, ?cause the    right.  </li><li>o michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> generally, you?d have to look at other evidence including  witness statements and those kinds of   yes.  16  ausa  dr.  ausa  drdr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  dr.  dr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  is-is also a wa</li><li>a michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot in the back, in his-in his back, and the autopsy shows that there are no entry wounds to the back, then that helps you to assess the reliability of those witnesses.  yes.  is that-that </li><li>o michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s back?  no.  or to his buttocks or the back of his legs?  no.  alright. at the ah, news conference on august 18th, um, when ah, mr. (phonetic) was doing a, a sort of a brief summary of the find</li><li> with mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> jerking when he was shot while going away from the police officer. is that right, that it could be consistent with that?  say it again.  alright, at the-at the i think we?ve already covered this</li><li> with mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> being shot from behind. the police officer standing behind him and shooting at   it could be but (ui).  20  au sa  dr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  dr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  dr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  dr.  ausa </li><li>uation of <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s hands, ya know. but, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>'s hands didn?t show any injuries but that doesn?t mean you can punch somebody and not have injuries.  alright.    so.  well, and   i?m sorry. can i just have one que</li><li>now. but, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>'s hands didn?t show any injuries but that doesn?t mean you can punch somebody and not have injuries.  alright.    so.  well, and   i?m sorry. can i just have one question. so, um, so wilson's me</li><li>injury to <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s eye.  ah-ah-ah, to a it-it would help inform me of what injuries that a could be accounted for by ah, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> injuring wilson on his hands and things and the cut on his arm, ah, and it could um,</li><li>or by ah, <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> injuring wilson on his hands and things and the cut on his arm, ah, and it could um, tell me um if any injury?s on wilson?s hand might reflect something about his striking <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, if there was a </li><li> striking <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, if there was a tussle going on.  okay.  24  drdr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  if there's some kind of argument going on.  but, wilson?s medical records wouldn?t tell you about the gunshot wounds though.</li><li>w michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> died. is that what you?re saying?  in general yeah. okay.  in that regard too, i mean, one information about um, whether or not the findings on <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is consistent with the findings-findings on </li><li>ndings on <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is consistent with the findings-findings on wilson and also it goes to a broader picture ya know, was-was wilson ticked off at him? was a, was <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> ya know unduly ah-ah um acting in a-in a reck</li><li>as a, was <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> ya know unduly ah-ah um acting in a-in a reckless matter at that time but that goes more to your guys than to the autopsy findings.  yeah, and i, we?ll talk about that a little bit more here in </li><li> with mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> moving forward falling forward and his momentum carrying him where it would scrape his forehead against the ground as he hit the ground?  yes. you started with the gunshot to the apex of the hea</li><li> that mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s hand was in close proximity with the weapon at the time that that shot was fired. um, would that be your opinion today after seeing the slide   well, i saw the slides.  ya   and i think it-it </li><li> with mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s hand being in-inside the police officer?s  vehicle very close to his firearm at the time it was discharged.  a close to, i mean within in there i mean anywhere it would i mean, in  the hand in</li><li>rt of mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s hand where the  ah, graze wound is, could?ve been just within a few inches of the muzzle  of the firearm. could be.  alright. now, you said ah, you referred, you said you were wrong about, ya </li><li>ether mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was impaired or whether there were   the one that does give me    the delta9thc and um the thing about it is um, it?s negative in the urine but it?s 12 navigrams (phonetic) in don?t know in the </li><li>ot any of <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s actions at the time of the cigar incident and walking the street and wasn?t anyway affected by the marijuana. ah, and i can?t say. ?cause i say most people wouldn?t get too much out of line wi</li><li>missioner <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> holding up, did you see the picture of holding up 30-30 grams of marijuana in a-in a plastic bag which is an ounce which now is okay in new york. it?s an awful lot to me. but-but at least it doe</li><li>o michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>'s body, ah, specific to the autopsy itself. and you?d indicated that there were no signs of struggle regarding his body um, at that time and ah, but you would need more information to side wheth</li><li>es to mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>'s neck suggesting that he was strangled or grabbed around the neck in any way?  again, ah, no. i didn't see any. that doesn?t mean he wasn?t, but he- he?s a big guy to get hands around the neck.</li><li>m michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> at six foot five and 289 pounds  about that, yeah. he looked bigger than that actually but they have a, i think they have a good scale over there at the medical examiner?s office and was only wh</li><li>r and mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>.  right, and whether-whether he suffered serious injury,  if there was bruising or contusions to the side of the police officer?s face and scratch marks on the back of his neck. those would  be </li><li>es to mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s knuckles or hands. in order to break bones in somebody yeah.  right. but, if-if there are no broken bones but there are bruises, if there is bruising, you may not necessarily injuries-see inju</li><li>es to mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>'s hands.  that?s correct.  okay. we've talked about a little bit tonight and i know that in previous statements you?ve mentioned the importance of um, of forensic evidence like the autopsy in ah</li><li> that mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was down on the ground face down as-as he was found and ah, the police officer fired repeatedly six or eight shots into-into his back. obviously the autopsy would indicate that-that would not be</li><li>f michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s head had occurred in a hospital and he was-and he was given immediate attention, he wouldn't have survived.  that?s my opinion, yes.  and, certainly cpr at the scene or anything like that woul</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> in this case?  no-no. i?m saying that from my autopsy findings i can tell you my opinions clearly. as for as question about excessive force, it?s my feeling over the years that ah, there was exc</li><li>a michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, ya know. this is-is a was, i mean last week in jamaica to a, ya know, a death and a confrontation. a, but it?s-it?s a a great problem and i think it?s become even greater because of ah, of the </li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> from doing whatever he was  doing at the time, is that fair?  59  dr.  au sa  dr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  dr.  ausa  dr.  au sa  dr.  ausa  drexperience, when a person is shot two, three, four times </li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> not what your past   it would not  be with how people act.  no, they, it would not necessarily would have immobilized him, um, true.  in other words he would still be capable of moving. he may h</li><li>o michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> then that one may have been necessary to stop him and immobilize him if the other ones had not, is that right?  no, i don?t believe that. i don?t believe that. even if the sh-ah, getting a bulle</li><li>f michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> attacked the police officer in his car, he shot in the the thumb, he runs away from the car, the police officer gets out of the car, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> comes running back at him. i understand you?re </li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> comes running back at him. i understand you?re saying that based on your experience of how people act that-that you think that?s unlikely. but, if that was in fact the case, would that affect yo</li><li>d michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, correct?  yeah.  the big question here is ah, the circumstances surrounding it. a large part ofthat which would be the witness statements.  that?s part of it, yeah.  alright, okay. alright, let</li><li>ed by the <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> family. we don?t, we legitimately don?t have a side that now is prosecutor for.  but, i?m retired. just-just you understand. i?m doing this pro bono. okay.  was asked by ah, by the naacp and a-a</li><li>esent mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s family? yes. okay. yeah.  alright. those are people you?ve talked to about the ah, the details of the case?  and what i was gonna say is as far as the autopsy goes, apart from the hand the gun</li><li> to-to ah <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> in this case has-has lit up places otherwise that-that deaths that would have gone unnoticed have suddenly become noticed that the newspapers reported on that and- and i think that they-they, we</li><li>ld to mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>.  okay, and so after that, i?m assuming they   yes.  into the building then and-and you waited for us, is that right?  yes.  okay. um, would you please retell and i?m just gonna set the recorder</li><li>cause mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, my initial thought was he?s a big guy. he?s tall and like stocky build and that?s it. he-he, they both walked passed me. i took my tools, went into i came back outside to get some m</li><li>own, mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, my initial thought was he?s a big guy. he?s tall and like stocky build and that?s it. he-he, they both walked passed me. i took my tools, went into i came back outside to get some more stuff an</li><li> seen mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> in the window of the police car looked. . . it appeared as they were wrestling through the window and one gunshot had let off. and, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> took off running and my first thought was like ?oh m</li><li> and, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> took off running and my first thought was like ?oh my gosh? did i actually just witness a police officer being murdered because it took a while for the police officer to get out of the car and p</li><li>suing mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>. mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was quite a distance and he stopped and when he stopped, he didn?t get down on the ground or anything. he turned around and he did some type of movement. i never seen him put his hand</li><li>rown. mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was quite a distance and he stopped and when he stopped, he didn?t get down on the ground or anything. he turned around and he did some type of movement. i never seen him put his hands up or any</li><li>re on mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>. um, if i had to guess the shots and the-the distance between him and, a, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, it would have to be five to ten yards and the shots that were fired was four, five to six shots fired and mr.</li><li>d, a, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, it would have to be five to ten yards and the shots that were fired was four, five to six shots fired and mr.  4  det.  <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was still standing up. um, and my thoughts was while he?s missing t</li><li> 4  det.  <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was still standing up. um, and my thoughts was while he?s missing this guy this close, is he-is he hitting him or because mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> there was no reaction from him to show that he was been hit. u</li><li>cause mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> there was no reaction from him to show that he was been hit. um, after that, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> then paused. he-he-he stopped running and when he stopped running the police officer stopped firing. and, t</li><li>that, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> then paused. he-he-he stopped running and when he stopped running the police officer stopped firing. and, then mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> continued, started again to charge towards him and after that the police </li><li> then mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> continued, started again to charge towards him and after that the police officer returned fire and um well not returned, i?m using wrong. . .a started to fire once more at him. um, if i had to g</li><li> that mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> collapsed and fell to the ground.  okay. what happened then?  um, what happened then after that um i didn?t see, it was a-a blue monte carlo, a-a newer model monte carlo, two-door and um, it was</li><li>nd um mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s friend that he was walking with earlier, i didn?t see him the whole time that um this was all going on with, a, confrontation with the police and the shooting and everything. at the end, after</li><li>after mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> had dropped and um, i seen the, his friend come out of-of nowhere and run across the street and a, said that, ?dog, they just-they just killed him. they just killed him? and he ran um, the back </li><li> when mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> did run, i thought i heard a, something? metal hit the ground and i?m not sure what it was but i thought i heard somethin? hit the ground. and um, after that i believe, i?m not sure um, if i wen</li><li>king, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> had a tan, tan pants, a red hat, ?ip flops. it might have-it may have been tan shorts. yeah, it had to be tan shorts, because i?m not sure of the color. i know they were shorts because his socks</li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was the one that you thought to yourself um, that?s a big guy?  yeah, it is. is that right?  yeah.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  okay. and, which</li><li>i see mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> leaned over inside the police car um, at maybe i see his back at his um, probably below you, what would you call, like under your armpit.  beneath your armpits?  yeah. a little bit deeper than, </li><li>n was mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s body. okay. and what was his body doin??  at that distance i-i-i couldn?t tell. it looked like a?a confrontation and all i could assume was some type of confrontation was going on in the car. </li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is in the car?  um, maybe at least ten seconds from what i seen.  okay. and at the end of that ten seconds, what happens?  a gunshot.  okay. and then what happens after that gunshot goes off?  m</li><li>off?  mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> ran.  okay, do you know where that gunshot came from?  no, i do not.  okay. so, before he runs he leaves the car?  yes.  okay, so he kinda comes out of the car then and then he runs, right?  uh </li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> runs east on. . .east, where at is he running actually?  he?s running in the middle of the street at like, at a slant um and the it will be the first driveway on the left from the squad car that</li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> in running east heading towards that-that parking lot, right?  yes.  the officer comes out of the car. how is the officer, you said with his gun drawn. how is the officer holding his gun?  just </li><li> seen mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turn and he like did somethin? i don?t know if was to pull his pants up. it was some type of motion that took place with mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s body gesture and after that, um, he began to run towards the </li><li> with mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s body gesture and after that, um, he began to run towards the police officer.  okay, so from the time that-that you hear that first gunshot and the officer gets out of the car until the time th</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops and-and turns around and faces the officer, right?  uh huh.  do you hear any gunshots between that-that period right there?  no.  okay. so, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, he turns around, correct?  </li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, he turns around, correct?  uh huh.  and where are his hands at at that point, do you know?  um, i know for sure they weren?t above his head.  okay. okay, so let?s go back to the officer i</li><li>proaching <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, right?  uh huh.  <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, turns around, and just so i?m clear what happens at that point then? you?re at the point where mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, turns   uh huh. he stops; he turns around.  turns a</li><li> uh huh.  <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, turns around, and just so i?m clear what happens at that point then? you?re at the point where mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, turns   uh huh. he stops; he turns around.  turns around, he does some body</li><li>where mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> stops, turns   uh huh. he stops; he turns around.  turns around, he does some body gesture, and ?m thinkin? he pulled his shorts up. i can?t really recall on what all happened. all i know is i s</li><li>e michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s hands when he?s. . .you said he does this thing with his-with his pants right?  yeah.  or something. um, what does he do after he does that?  he runs. he?s at a charging motion.  okay. and, wh</li><li>?  a, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> then paused and the police officer a, cease fire and mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> then tried to charge once more and that?s when the police officer opened fired.  so <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> charged again and the officer opened fire</li><li>e and mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> then tried to charge once more and that?s when the police officer opened fired.  so <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> charged again and the officer opened fire again? yes.  is that what you said? okay. and then what happen</li><li>ired.  so <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> charged again and the officer opened fire again? yes.  is that what you said? okay. and then what happens?  he collapsed in the street.  did you see the officer a, touch him at all or anything l</li><li>ot a, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> that was doin? the tapin?. i know when i came back outside i really wasn?t focused then on did another police car show up. what drew my attention was i seen one police officer, um, taping off th</li><li>where mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was fatally injured and he came from nowhere and ran across the street and it would be at the point where he ran across will be in front of the squad car.  okay.  and, he cuts across and yells a</li><li>n  a, mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was laying on the ground.  okay, alright. a, when you went how many people did you tell?  just one.  14  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  just one.  yeah.  and t</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was on the ground, how long do you think it lasted?  um, maybe two minutes.  okay, alright. you have anything?  did we get an address of where you?re workin?? no.  no, it was on just east of  no</li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, at the driver window of the ferguson police car. i?m not  2  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  sure what was exchanged, um, somethin? was definitely goin? on in the wi</li><li>e michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> and his friend runs away from the ferguson police car.  let me stop you real quick. um, while they were at the-the door there, uh, or well michael was at the   yes.  w-what do you think, or what</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s arm, he-he might have been punchin? the police officer or whatever. somethin? was goin? on through the window.  there?s some kinda movement, exchange   yeah, some kinda movement, you   goin? o</li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s to my left.  yes. in the window and the other guy was in the   so you see   like, away. kinda   how far?  probably three, four, maybe five feet away from the car.  3  det.  det.  det.  det.  d</li><li>s michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was.  okay.  so, um, like i said, all of a sudden theyjust immediately runs away from the car.  they both did?  they both did.  which direction did they go?  um, the fir-um, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> just r</li><li>, michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> just runs back   behind the vehicle.  yeah, behind the vehicle, runnin? straight down the road as the friend, um, he just ducks behind the first car that was parked off to the side which is like</li><li>d michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is already probably, like, 25   down the road.  the road.  okay.  so, um, like i said, he hops out the car, um, the first three four shots that i noticed that was taken, i, that?s when i yelled </li><li>s michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> facing?  michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is facin? away from him.  so he?s still running?  yeah, he, uh, he   5  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  et.  et.  et.  with his back to the officer. with h</li><li>  michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is facin? away from him.  so he?s still running?  yeah, he, uh, he   5  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  det.  et.  et.  et.  with his back to the officer. with his back to the officer.</li><li>g michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> backed up?

(ui)  car was right here so he probably went only like right there. not far. ok.  so when, when michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> fell to the ground, were you further ahead from him? fur</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> fell to the ground, were you further ahead from him? further..further down the street from where he was?  closer to west florissant than he was. ok.  so you were closer to the police vehicle tha</li><li>r michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> went and then when he, he um..when he turned around, and you heard those shots. you said \"he turned around and then i heard the rest of the shots?. you said told you i can?t see that far, but i </li><li>w michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?s arms and hands?  uh, about shoulder and ear length. ok, can you just show me..again? oh, yeah. about like this.  ok so, ok so i just for the tape and you tell me if it?s..if it?s correct. you </li><li>h michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> took a few steps backward, and that?s where he..that's where he fell. and then you also said he had never come..once he reached that point and turned around, he didn?t come forward at all. is th</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> ran, did you leave that spot?  yeah, i started kinda towards my house but not ready to, you know leave from where was from cuz i was still watching.  ok. so you were wal, as this was, as michael</li><li>s michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was running, you were also walking. is that right?

 uh, you saw them get in some type of physical altercation for about, uh it was about 15</li><li> and mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> you said kinda backed   yeah.    he ran not by about 4 or 5 steps and then he stopped.  okay. which direction did he, maybe you can show   he was goin in the same direction as his friend was goi</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>, when there was a first shot that he turned and ran a few steps, uh, what was goin on with the officer at that time? ?cause at that this time the gun ..there?s a gun on the ground.  oh, i wasn?t</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>.  yeah. ?cause, you know when heard the first shot, i?m looking like did he get shot?

 a whole lot of people. it was like a-a women walking down the street that was on the side of and people sittin? outside with the kids a</li><li>with mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> at the time?  ut huh. lwasn?t paying that much attention. okay.  like i say i remember seeing people around, but i didn?t see exactly what happened before the shots.  um huh.  and i didn?t see w</li><li> see mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> and-and what happens then?  okay, a by the time i looked up, mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was already running towards the corner.  okay.  and the officer had the pistol in hand and was chasing him and fired a cou</li><li> up, mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was already running towards the corner.  okay.  and the officer had the pistol in hand and was chasing him and fired a couple of shots at him while he was running, and i seen mike turn around li</li><li>e as mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was running away the police officer a was shooting at him.  um huh.  and a shot him in the hip and the leg, do you remember that?  okay maybe ?cause the way he was jerking. seemed like to me tha</li><li> see mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turn around and you?d mention on again on august 21st that his hands went up briefly but then they came down.  yes.  and by the time he was moving back towards the police officer his hands were </li><li>after mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> and shooting at him as he?s running away.  yes.  and on august 21st you described it appeared that mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot in the hip and the leg. is that right?  yeah.  okay and um then um back on a</li><li> that mr. <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was shot in the hip and the leg. is that right?  yeah.  okay and um then um back on august 21st you indicated that um as you have today that mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was coming back towards the police officer</li><li>that mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was coming back towards the police officer, is that right?  um huh, yeah.  and i think you?d said you couldn?t tell whether he was stumbling or running at the police officer, do you remember tha</li><li>fast mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was coming back towards the officer, you said \"he may have been running, he may have been stumbling?.  um huh, yeah.  what-what leads you to think he may have been running?  i?ve seen people ang</li><li>s michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was running away that he, the police officer fired three shots at him as he was facing away from the officer. um, the detective asked   i guess, i can?t really remember that. and the (sighs).  y</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was not shot in the hip or the leg, okay?    18  ausa  ausa  au sa  au sa  au sa  ausa  au sa  okay, he wasn?t shot in the back or the rear end or the back ofthe legs or anything like that indic</li><li>n michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is running away and the police officer is chasing him, did you-did you get a good look at that, did you only hear the shots, did you see the shots.  i saw them running.  okay.  and i heard the s</li><li>that mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turned around and was coming back towards the police officer. are you anymore sure about that, than you are about the other things?  that i have the same one?  that-that were you looking at it f</li><li>g michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> and you said you saw his, you saw the police officer holding his gun, right?  um huh.  21  au sa  and that?s a yes right 'cause the recorder.  yes, i?m sorry.  your fine.  i?m tryin? a remember.</li><li>s michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was running away from the officer or could it be possible that the shots didn?t start again until after he turned around?  i wanna say that i heard the shots as he was running away.  okay.  were</li><li> and mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> from where you were seated or were you watching one or the other?  they were both like, it looked like to me that they were standing almost next to each other and i seen mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> take off runn</li><li>seen mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> take off running and then the police officer kinda followed him.  so at the   he followed him.  so at the very beginning when you first look up you actually see both the police officer and-and m</li><li>d michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> standing by the car?  at the very beginning when i first look up, the first thing i saw was mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> running in the opposite direction.  okay.  and then i seen the officer chasing him. did you</li><li> was mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> running in the opposite direction.  okay.  and then i seen the officer chasing him. did you see the officer.  with the gun drawn.  i?m sorry did you see the officer actually get out of the car o</li><li>t michael <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turned around and started coming back toward the officer?  he got to the corner. he got about to the corner before he turned around.  and then did in, and then when, and then from the time that </li><li>when mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> hit the ground.  okay.  what?s.  that?s probably eight feet?  yeah, about right.  about right?  okay.  does that, does that sound about right?  ahh, i guess, i?m not good with measurements. yeah</li><li>s-as mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was coming towards the officer, was the officer backing away? did the distance stay the same, did mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> close the distance to where it was longer when he turned around and then got shorter,</li><li> did mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> close the distance to where it was longer when he turned around and then got shorter, if you can tell me?  if got shorter, i don?t believe that the officer moved. like he was standing there in t</li><li>when mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> came back um he got to the corner, her turned around, his hands was up and then he started coming back so i guess the officer, yeah he was just  standing there. and he was standing there shootin</li><li>when mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is coming towards him the distance is getting shorter between the two.  yeah it?s getting shorter.  okay, about how far do you think mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> came back from the point he turned around until th</li><li>hink mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> came back from the point he turned around until the point where he hit the ground?  he was about eight fee when he hit the ground, from the officer. okay, but i?m talking about the distance from</li><li>here mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turns around and is coming back towards the officer. do you feel more sure about that than you do about the part before that? you- you?d had mentioned that you had kinda had some doubts about th</li><li>t at mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> as he was  running away whether the leg and you told us today that you know he may, your-your not real sure about that.  26  au sa  au sa  ausa  ausa  au sa  au sa  ausa  um huh.  after hearing </li><li>when mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turned around?  yeah when mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turnt around the  and was coming back toward him.  officer was still firing the gun.  okay.  yeah.  alright. you feel pretty sure about that?  feel pretty su</li><li>when mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> turnt around the  and was coming back toward him.  officer was still firing the gun.  okay.  yeah.  alright. you feel pretty sure about that?  feel pretty sure about that.  okay.  i kinda axked </li><li>here mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> is turned around and is coming back towards him?  yeah.  alright, okay. you say you-you?ve asked yourself that question \"why was the police officer still shooting at him?.  yeah like that?s-that</li><li>that mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> might have been running back towards the police officer?  um, it was the discussion, the discussion that we had after we drove away from it. that made me unsure of what happened because it seeme</li><li>what mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was doing?  yeah what he was doing 'cause i said that it looked like it he was stumbling, someone else said looked like he was charging and was like well his hand was on his chest. you know we t</li><li>that mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span> was coming back towards the police officer.  yeah.  and the question in your mind was just, was he running or was he stumbling forward.  yes. is that right, in your mind.  29  au sa  au sa  ausa</li><li>bout mike <span class=\"highlighted\">brown</span>?
